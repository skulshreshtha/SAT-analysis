# SAT Analysis

#### Preface
The **SAT** (__Scholastic Aptitude Test__) is a standardized test widely used for college admissions in the United States. 
The test is divided into 3 sections, each of which has a total score of 800. High schools are often ranked by their average SAT scores, and high SAT scores are considered a sign of how good a school district is.

This project utilizes different datasets taken from the **NYC OpenData** initiative. The main idea here was to combine data from multiple associated data sources and perform exploratory data analysis on it to understand:
1. Are schools differentiated by SAT scores?
2. The schools which are doing best and the ones which are doing worse, what are the key differentiating factors between these schools?
3. Do demographics really play a role in SAT scores? If yes, then how and which demographic categories are doing better than others
